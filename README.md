is a Javascript game written according to the recommendations of good practices and the functional paradigm. 
The code applies the principles of function composition and mutability, monads for handling NULL values, 
pure functions and other principles that support this paradigm.

Functional programming originated as a principle of writing clean code that is easy to debug and maintain. 
The goal is to write simple and compact functions that have no side effects, modeled after mathematical functions.
These functions are then composed using the reduce() function to achieve the desired action.
